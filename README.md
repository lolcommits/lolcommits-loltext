[lolcommits](https://lolcommits.github.io/) takes a snapshot with your webcam
every time you git commit code, and archives a lolcat style image with it. Git
blame has never been so much fun!

This plugin annotates each lolcommit with the commit message and sha text. You
can style and position these however you like, or add a transparent overlay
color that covers the entire image.

By default your lolcommit will look something like this (maybe without the
horse):

![horse
commit](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits-loltext/raw/master/assets/images/horse.jpg)

You can easily change the plugin options to achieve something like this:

![hipster
commit](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits-loltext/raw/master/assets/images/hipster.jpg)

See [below](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits-loltext#configuration) for
more information on the options available.

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 2.3
* A webcam
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) (optional) for animated gif capturing

## Installation

By default, this plugin is automatically included with the main lolcommits gem.
If you have uninstalled this gem, install it again with:

    $ gem install lolcommits-loltext

That's it! Every lolcommit will now be stamped with your commit message and sha.
This plugin is enabled by default (if no configuration for it exists). To
disable (so no text or overlay is applied) use:

    $ lolcommits --config -p loltext
    # and set enabled to `false`

### Configuration

Configure this plugin with:

    $ lolcommits --config -p loltext
    # set enabled to `true` (then set your own options or choose the defaults)

The following options are available:

* text color
* text font
* text position
* uppercase text?
* size (point size for the font)
* stroke color (font outline color, or none)
* transparent overlay (cover the image with a random background color)
* transparent overlay % (sets the fill colorize strength)

Please note that:

* The message and sha text can have different text options
* Any blank options will use the default (indicated when prompted for an option)
* Always use the full absolute path to font files
* Valid text positions are NE, NW, SE, SW, S, C (centered)
* Colors can be hex values (#FC0) or strings (white, red etc.)
* You can set one or more `overlay_colors` to pick from, separated with commas

With these options it is possible to create your own unique lolcommit format.
To achieve these '[hipster
styled](https://twitter.com/matthutchin/status/738411190343368704)' ðŸ•¶ commits,
try the following:

```
loltext:
  :enabled: true
  :message:
    :color: white
    :font: "/Users/matt/Library/Fonts/Raleway-Light.ttf"
    :position: C
    :size: 30
    :stroke_color: none
    :uppercase: true
  :sha:
    :color: white
    :font: "/Users/matt/Library/Fonts/Raleway-Light.ttf"
    :position: S
    :size: 20
    :stroke_color: none
    :uppercase: false
  :overlay:
    :enabled: true
  :border:
    :enabled: false
```

**NOTE**: you can grab the '_Raleway-Light_' font for free from
[fontsquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Raleway).
